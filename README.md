# Mario-and-Dragon-game

This is a simple game implemented using the Pygame library in Python. The game is called "Mario" and involves controlling a character named Mario to avoid obstacles and survive as long as possible.

Here is a brief description of the project:

1. The game window has a width of 1200 pixels and a height of 600 pixels. The frames per second (FPS) is set to 20.
2. There are two types of obstacles in the game: cactus and fire. The cactus is located at the top of the window, and the fire is located at the bottom.
3. The player controls Mario, who starts at the left side of the window and can move up and down using the arrow keys.
4. The dragon is another character in the game that moves vertically between the cactus and fire obstacles.
5. Flames are continuously spawned from the right side of the window and move towards the left.
6. The player's score increases as they avoid collisions with the flames. The score is displayed on the screen.
7. The game has multiple levels, and the difficulty increases as the player's score progresses.
8. The game features a top score that is updated if the player achieves a higher score.
9. If Mario collides with either the cactus or fire, the game ends and the player's score is recorded. The game over screen is displayed.
10. The game provides an option to restart by pressing any key after the game over screen.

Overall, the project demonstrates basic game development concepts such as character movement, collision detection, scoring, and level progression.
